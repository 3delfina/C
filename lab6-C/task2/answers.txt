a)
The output periods are the following:
The Period of function randu(), with seed 1520729275 is 536870911
The Period of function randu(), with seed 1520729296 is 33554431
The Period of function randu(), with seed 1520729311 is 536870911
The Period of function randu(), with seed 1520729332 is 134217727

b)
See makefile and main.c

c)
Compare the results of the tests on the three PRNGs 
	1) which is the best of the three?
	2) Which is the worst? 
	3) What features differentiate the 3 PRNGs?

The Period of function randu(), with seed 1520864354 is 268435455
The Period of function MT, with seed 1520864354 is -1
The Period of function rand(), with seed 1520864354 is -1

The Period of function randu(), with seed 1520864618 is 268435455
The Period of function MT, with seed 1520864618 is -1
The Period of function rand(), with seed 1520864618 is -1

The Period of function randu(), with seed 1520864781 is 536870911
The Period of function MT, with seed 1520864781 is -1
The Period of function rand(), with seed 1520864781 is -1

1) Both MT and rand() seem to be the best as brute force period test returned -1 meaning it reached max_period without finding a period. However, testing rand() with test_roulette gives results which are closer to theoretical distribution, so I would say it is better.

2) randu() is the worst PNGR as for every test case the period was found.

3) MT is different from randu() and rand() as when testing it with test_roulette its values differ noticeably from the theoretical distribution.
  For randu() the period was found in all of the cases, but test_roulette produces values which are close to the  theoretical distribution.
  For rand() the period was not found and the values were quite close to the theoretical ones.
